<p>
	These are books I have read. I usually read a couple of books at the same time. The rating system is very simple:
	<ul style='list-style-type:none'>                                          
		<li>*  Burn it. Never speak about it and if someone ask: you haven't read it.</li>			
		<li>**  Perfect for stabilising chairs and tables. </li>			
		<li>***  Nice reading for a boring afternoon.</li>
		<li>****  You can learn from this book.</li>			
		<li>*****  You are a different person after reading this. A must read.</li>
	</ul>
