# So you have an idea
                      
It is a special idea that you had while you were in the bath. You think is brilliant. You think it will give you tons of money in a very short period of time. You think you are the only person in the world that had thought about it. You think you can get it done in a couple of weeks.
                                                                                                 
No.

The idea is worth nothing. __It is the ability to execute an idea the only thing that really matters.__ 

Many people has had the same idea before. But they all built something quite different. The reason is that each one of them was created by a team with different abilities, vision, intelligence and enthusiasm. 

You are here because you lack the ability to do it all by yourself alone. You understand that __you need to build a team__, a group of people with different abilities that when combined can produce something meaningful.

I am a creative person with a very marked entrepreneurial attitude and technical skills in server side programming. I will be happy to be part of the team you are building.

# What is in it for me?

My heart is satisfied with building something meaningful for the generations to come. Like a poet, I want to be famously remembered by next generations.

In the mean time, I also need money to pay the bills and enjoy a good steak with red wine.

I sincerely can't estimate how much time a project is going to take. So we will work in weekly units. 

You will tell me what is the most important feature of your project. I will divide that feature in smaller units and then I will start working on them. I will try that each one of these units can be developed in one week. That way each week you will have something useful.

When you decide that you have enough functionality, then we stop the development.

That is technically called Behaviour Driven Development.       

My fee for each week is around 700 â‚¬. To be paid each week.                   

# Lets get started!

Cool! But there is a little problem. I can't take all the projects in the world. I need to choice between them. You need to convince me that you are capable of building a business and you know what you want to do.

Draw a big globe. It is the global market. Each one of your competitors has a stake on it. __What is your stake in the world?__ What makes you and the product you want to build different from the competition?

Avoid dumb answers. Don't deceive yourself. 'We are going to have a much better design!' is __not__ an answer. Showing me an actual design in a piece of paper where I can see that you have discovered a better way to enhance the user experience __is__ an answer. 

Tell me who is in the team. That way I can google them and see what they had done and how awesome their work is and fantasize about the cool things we can do together.
