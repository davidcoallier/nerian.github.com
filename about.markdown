I am a <b>freelance developer</b>, meaning that I am available to work in your projects for a fixed weekly salary.

I have a degree in Computer Science with a specialisation in economy and management.

I reside in the souther lands of Spain but I am available for working as a freelance in all the world. 

I am fluent in English – officially B2 european level – and in Spanish, which is my mother tongue.
