---              

My name is Gonzalo Rodríguez-Baltanás Díaz, 22, and I am a specialist in web application development with Ruby and NoSQL databases such as MongoDB.                                     
                                               
I am freelance developer, meaning that I am available to work in your projects for a fixed weekly salary. Check the <a href='/hireme'>hire section</a> for more information regarding the way I work.

I have a degree in Computer Science with an specialisation in economy and management.

I reside in the souther lands of Spain but I am available for working as a freelance in all the world. 

I am fluent in English – officially B2 european level – and in Spanish, which is my mother tongue.

When I am not coding I am either thinking on new business ideas, swimming or reading a book.
