My name is Gonzalo Rodríguez. I can make you win more money, or reduce your current costs, by leveraging modern web technologies, effective agile techniques and a good deal of communication.

Nowadays I prefer to use Ruby on Rails, MongoDB and RSpec as I find them to be excellent tools. But I am not afraid to use different technologies if they are proven to be better suited.

Hiring me cost 400 € per week. You can expect 40 hours of work per week.

We will work remotely, constantly communicating using email and Skype.

Let me know how can I help you at <a href="mailto:gonzalo.rodriguez@nerian.es">gonzalo.rodriguez@nerian.es</a>
