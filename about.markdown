title: About me

My name is Gonzalo Rodríguez, freelance web developer. I can make you win more money, or reduce your current costs, by leveraging modern web technologies, effective agile techniques and a good deal of communication.

Nowadays I prefer to use Ruby on Rails, MongoDB, RSpec, Steak, GIT and Heroku as I find them to be excellent tools. But I am not afraid to use different technologies if they are proven to be better suited.

I am also a great advocate of Behaviour Driven Development and Agile Project Management, which means you will get fully tested quality software.

We will work remotely, constantly communicating using email and Skype.

Hiring me cost 600 € per week.

Let me know how can I help you at <a href="mailto:gonzalo.rodriguez@nerian.es">gonzalo.rodriguez@nerian.es</a>
