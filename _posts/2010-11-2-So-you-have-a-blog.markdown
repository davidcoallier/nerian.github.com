title: What a minute, not a Wordpress blog?

This is a genuine html 5 and css 3 static web page generated using Jekyll and hosted at GitHub. Isn't it cool?

I can just write this post using my favourite text editor, Textmate, and use Git to upload everything to GitHub. Then GitHub automatically parses everything through Jerkyll and voil√†, the dish is served!

Big thanks to Tom Preston-Werner for creating Jekyll and Vincent Driessen for design inspiration.
