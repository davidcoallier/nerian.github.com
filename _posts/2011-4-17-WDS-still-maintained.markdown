### What is Still Maintained and why it's so useful

So every once in a while you take a look at your Github's project list and say 'Damn, I have got a whole bunch of issues and pull request on projects that I do not want to maintain any longer'. You can do three things.

1. You can ignore all of them.
2. You can answer to each one of them telling that that project is no longer maintained.
3. Or you can use Still Maintained.

What Still Maintained do is very simple: It gives you an elegant interface to update the status of your Github projects. 

Now if you have, like you should, a Readme file in your Github repo you could add a magic image in it, that changes automatically to the correct status of your project. This is all handled by Still Maintained. 

All you have to add to your Readme file is a link to an image:                                                 
               

	<img alt='' src='http://stillmaintained.com/Nerian/nerian.github.com.png'/>

	<img alt='' src='http://stillmaintained.com/{GithubUserName}/{NameOfTheProject}.png'/>
{:lang="html"}
    
### Example

This is how a Still Maintained powered Readme looks like:
                                       
<p><a href='https://github.com/Nerian/nerian.github.com'>https://github.com/Nerian/nerian.github.com</a></p>

So go ahead: <p><a href='http://stillmaintained.com/'>http://stillmaintained.com/</a></p>
