### Fuubar

I love programming following the Behaviour Driven Development agile methodology. In few words, it means that you write the code that makes a test pass, nothing less, nothing more. It helps me to always know what is the next piece of code I have to write, so I never wander through randoms ideas or refactorings without a purpose.

What I want to show you is a little gem that makes the output of your RSpec tests a little prettier.
