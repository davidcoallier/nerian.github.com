GOOF is the acronym of Get Out Of Facebook. It is a Ruby on Rails application I developed as a part of the course _Project_ at the FUNP university.                                                       

It is more of a technical demo than a full-fledge application. The objective was to gain some valuable experience developing Facebook applications.                                                                    
                
It is built on the top of <a href='https://github.com/arsduo/koala'>Koala</a>, a Ruby library for Facebook applications.

The code is available <a href='https://github.com/Nerian/Goofb'>here</a>

And the application is running <a href='http://goof.heroku.com'>here</a>
