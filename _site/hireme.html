			<h1 id="so-you-have-an-idea">So you have an idea</h1>

<p>It is a special idea that you had while you were in the bath. You think is brilliant. You think it will give you tons of money in a very short period of time. You think you are the only person in the world that had thought about it. You think you can get it done in a couple of weeks.</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>The idea is worth nothing. <strong>It is the ability to execute an idea the only thing that really matters.</strong> </p>

<p>Many people has had the same idea before. But they all built something quite different. The reason is that each one of them was created by a team with different abilities, vision, intelligence and enthusiasm. </p>

<p>You are here because you lack the ability to do it all by yourself alone. You understand that <strong>you need to build a team</strong>, a group of people with different abilities that when combined can produce something meaningful.</p>

<p>I am a creative person with a very marked entrepreneurial attitude and technical skills in server side programming. I will be happy to be part of the team you are building.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-in-it-for-me">What is in it for me?</h1>

<p>My heart is satisfied with building something meaningful for the generations to come. Like a poet, I want to be famously remembered by next generations.</p>

<p>In the mean time, I also need money to pay the bills and enjoy a good steak with red wine.</p>

<p>I sincerely can’t estimate how much time a project is going to take. So we will work in weekly units. </p>

<p>You will tell me what is the most important feature of your project. I will divide that feature in smaller units and then I will start working on them. I will try that each one of these units can be developed in one week. That way each week you will have something useful.</p>

<p>When you decide that you have enough functionality, then we stop the development.</p>

<p>That is technically called Behaviour Driven Development.       </p>

<p>My fee for each week is around 700 €. To be paid each week.                   </p>

<h1 id="lets-get-started">Lets get started!</h1>

<p>Cool! But there is a little problem. I can’t take all the projects in the world. I need to choice between them. You need to convince me that you are capable of building a business and you know what you want to do.</p>

<p>Draw a big globe. It is the global market. Each one of your competitors has a stake on it. <strong>What is your stake in the world?</strong> What makes you and the product you want to build different from the competition?</p>

<p>Avoid dumb answers. Don’t deceive yourself. ‘We are going to have a much better design!’ is <strong>not</strong> an answer. Showing me an actual design in a piece of paper where I can see that you have discovered a better way to enhance the user experience <strong>is</strong> an answer. </p>

<p>Tell me who is in the team. That way I can google them and see what they had done and how awesome their work is and fantasy about the cool things we can do together.</p>
