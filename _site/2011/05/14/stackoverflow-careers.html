	<br/>

		<p>Like most XXI century people , I have a Linkedin account. I listed my experience, education, positions, interests, etc and sent an invitation to colleges. </p>

<p>But when I look at a Linkedin profile of other developers I don’t really get to grasp what they are about. I find that Linkedin profiles doesn’t really get to represent the person they intent to introduce to potential employers. And so, that’s a failure.</p>

<p>Yesterday I received an invitation to create a profile in Stackoverflow careers. The email I received is one of the best advertising emails I have ever seen:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We’re impressed by your “ruby-on-rails” tag answers on Stack Overflow. In recognition of your generous spirit, we’d like to invite you to create a professional profile on Stack Overflow Careers 2.0.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>A Careers 2.0 profile is a great place to showcase your professional work as a programmer – Stack Exchange answers, open source projects, even the books you’ve read.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Click here to accept the invitation. It’s free!</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Even if you’re not looking for a new career today, your Careers 2.0 profile will be your professional home on the web. It lets your colleagues, friends, and peers know who you are and what great work you’re doing. It’s a terrific way to build your professional reputation and take your career to the next level. And it’s fun!</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>You’ll always have complete control over what’s in your profile, who can see it, and whether or not employers can contact you.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>But please act soon: this invitation expires in 14 days, so sign up now!</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Even if you decide not to join Careers 2.0, we would like to thank you for all your contributions to Stack Overflow. It wouldn’t be the same without you.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Best wishes,</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Joel, Jeff and The Stack Overflow Team</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now why do I think that? Here I go:</p>

<ul>
  <li>First paragraph: Instead of the obvious and false ‘My dear customer’ these guys make yourself proud of your hard work. They are saying something that is true. And they introduce you the product they want to sell as if it were a reward. That gives you a good feeling for the rest of the email.</li>
  <li>Second paragraph: A one line introduction to the thing they want to sell. </li>
  <li>Third paragraph: A quick call to action. And it tells you that it’s free.</li>
  <li>Fourth paragraph: Maybe you think you don’t need it, but…ey it’s free and you will need it in the future! It’s a perfect second – reinforcing – call to action.</li>
  <li>Fifth paragraph: Programmers like to feel in control. </li>
  <li>Sixth paragraph: It uses scarcity to make you act. It’s now or never.</li>
  <li>Seventh paragraph: Ey I am cool and you are cool, let be friends – but if you don’t want me, I cool with that. A classic line.</li>
</ul>

<p>And it ends with a friendly good bye. Now that’s how you sell a product. </p>

<p>But what really matters it is what happens next – when you use it. Is it a good product? Does it fulfil your needs? In short, after filling in your info, can a prospective employer really feel what you are about?</p>

<p>You tell me:</p>
