		<p>– Good evening – said the speaker, an old man with long white hair and deep blue eyes.</p>

<p>He paused, staring at the whole group of people before him</p>

<p>– Does anybody here knows something about history? – said the old man with a playful and childish voice – Does anybody knows what a slave is? </p>

<p>The people hesitated, looking at each other, pondering if he was just joking. </p>

<p>A young woman at the first line said ‘A slave is a person that is owned by someone else and is obliged to do what his master orders him to do. If the slave do it well, then the master rewards him with food and shelter, if he doesn’t do it well then the master punishes him’.</p>

<p>– Very good! That is, indeed, the classical definition of a slave, thank you! – said the old man happily – But tell me, my dear, do you think that those slaves will ever develop into people with a strong sense of purpose, self-direction, ambition, passion for their work? Do you think they will be the force pushing for creating a society with better quality of live?</p>

<p>– Ehm…no? – said the woman, confused. </p>

<p>– I agree! – said the old man – They will probably just cause massive riots and plunder what they can at any opportunity. </p>

<p>They audience nodded.</p>

<p>– Lets continue the argument. Does anybody knows what a student is?</p>

<p>A man raised his hand and said ‘A student is a child that we, as a civilised knowledge-based society put into an educational system so that they develop into an useful, knowledgeable, skilful adult man – or woman – so that they continue driving the society to upper levels of quality of living’</p>

<p>The old man smiled – Wonderful definition! And enlighten me, please, how do we exactly achieve all that?</p>

<p>The same man answered very confident.</p>

<p>– Well, we give them a strict set of obligatory classes and work that they must do. If they do it well then we reward them with good grades, if they don’t then we punish them with bad grades… – the man suddenly stop talking – oh shit.</p>

<p>The old man nodded his head, sad.</p>
