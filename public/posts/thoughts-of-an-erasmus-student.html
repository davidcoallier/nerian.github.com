  <h2>Thoughts of an Erasmus student: an anthropological Post-Mortem</h2>

  <small>2011-7-14</small>
</div>

<p>No more than 15 days ago I was still in Belgium as a part of my Erasmus scholarship. Now it is over. I am at home now but at the same time I feel like I am not really there. The Erasmus scholarship is an european scholarship that allows students from european universities to live and study in another european country. I was destined to Belgium.</p>

<p>When I first arrived to Belgium I didn&#39;t really know what I was supposed to do with the time I have been granted in complete independence. So the first thing I did was to go to a party :) </p>

<p>And when I came back to my room, deep in the night and not very sober, I opened my electronic diary and I wrote this simple line: &#39;The old ones drink to forget the past, while the young ones drink to forget about the future&#39;. The next morning, or more precisely, in the afternoon I had a thought about this. I didn&#39;t know neither what I wanted to do with my future, nor what I wanted to forget about my past.</p>

<p>I was told about the Erasmus scholarship that it is a time of reflection. A time for making decisions. When you are in you home, at your original country, you submit yourself to daily routines. You lost yourself in the process of living. But when you are taken from that and suddenly throw into a wild, exotic and unknown country where people speaks a language that is unknown to you... that&#39;s like submerging yourself in cold ice.</p>

<p>You open your eyes, fully awoken, and you ask yourself <em>What the fuck am I doing here?</em> The previous years of my life I have been doing the usual stuff. I went to School, then to College and finally to University. But I did that without a purpose. It was just what was expected from me.</p>

<p>It has taken a whole year for me to decide how to answer that question: I want to create something incredible. I want to create something so damn fucking useful that it will be used for decades by millions of souls - changing the way they interact with the world.</p>

<p>I have a very defined idea that I want to implement. I have 22 years of experience in learning environments, from public schools to private colleges and three different universities. I know where I did learn a lot and why. I know were I did not learn a shit and why. I know what today students need because I am one of them. I know what professors need because I have been speaking with them about that for years, they are in my family.</p>

<p>And finally, I have been honeying my web development skills for 2 years. I was born to do this.</p>

<p>The name of this secret project is Davinci. It is going to be the best e-learning tool in the world. And it is my gift to my fellow students and my awesome teachers.</p>

<p>Thank you for giving me an awesome education. I hope that with this your work will be even more awesome.</p>

<p>You will hear about it when it is ready :)</p>
